        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist.
        I build cool stuff, save the world occasionally, and look great doing it. Whether it's revolutionizing clean energy, creating AI assistants, or flying around in a weaponized metal suit, I bring unmatched flair and style to everything I do. Currently looking for new ways to outdo myself.</p>
